They are used to measure an individual\'s improvement over time, not to establish an arbitrary minimum level of activity.',165,''),(3631,'\0',8,'Posture: Posture is evaluated with a posture-rating chart. The Scout or Scouter is compared to a photo of his or her starting posture, noting 13 different body segments. Each body segment is scored as a five, three, or one, making a possible range of scores from 13 to 65. Higher scores over time reflect improving posture.\nAccuracy: The target throw is used to measure accuracy. The Scout or Scouter makes 20 throws with a softball at a circular target and is scored on the number of times the target is hit.\nStrength: The sit-up is used to measure strength. The Scout or Scouter lies on his or her back with knees bent and feet on the floor. The arms are crossed on the chest with the hands on the opposite shoulders. The feet are held by a partner to keep them on the floor. Curl to the sitting position until the elbows touch the thighs. Arms must remain on the chest and chin tucked on the chest. Return to the starting position, shoulder blades touching the floor. The score is the number of sit-ups made in a given time.\nAgility: The side step is used to measure agility. Starting from a center line, the Scout or Scouter sidesteps alternately left and right between two lines 8 feet apart. He or she is scored on the number of lines crossed in 10 seconds.\nSpeed: The dash is used to measure speed. The score is the amount of time to the nearest half-second running a set distance that can be increased each year.\nBalance: The squat stand is used to measure balance. The Scout or Scouter squats with hands on the floor and elbows against the inner knee. He or she leans forward until the feet are raised off the floor. The score is the number of seconds held in that position.\nEndurance: The squat thrust is used to measure endurance. The Scout or Scouter starts from the standing position. He or she performs the usual four-position exercise. The score is the number of completed squat thrusts made in a given time.\n\nSome of these tests measure more than the components they represent. For example, the sit-ups, a measure of strength, also reflect some endurance because of their repetition. The squat stand requires balance, its major component, but also requires strength and endurance to support the weight of the body on the arms.\n\n\nRequirements:',165,''),(3632,'\0',1,'   1.

Only recently, has the Boy Scouts of America decided that all of its members will wear the World Crest as a symbol of unity and world brotherhood.\n\nThe World Organization decided after the second World War that all member nations would issue and wear a patch with the World Crest on it as a sign of world brotherhood and unity among all Scouting organizations in teh then \'free world\'. The BSA along with a small group of other countries agreed but declined to carry out the mandate, stating that their program \'will do so when the time is right for it to happen\', stated then-Chief Scout Arthur Schuck.',167,''),(3642,'\0',3,'The first uses of the World Crest was during the World Jamboree in 1955, although the badge was available to Scouts and Scouters several years before. In 1956, however, the BSA decided that Scouts and Scouters that participate in an approved \'international activity or event\' would wear the Crest to and from that event as members of other nations would be doing. The following year, 1957, the BSA made the World Crest available to local Councils (it was previously only avaialbe from the BSA\'s International Service), and established the requirements which lasted until 1991: \'take part in an organized international activity or event with Scouts from another member nation of the World Association\'. It also established the World Crest as one of the few PERMANENT patches or insignia on the Boy Scout or Scouter\'s uniform.\n\nNo matter how many \'international activities\' you took part in, you could only wear ONE per life of the Scout. Nor could you purchase a World Crest without a card (similar to the Eagle Scout card) which states that you are indeed the holder of the World Crest.\n\nThe crest became known as the \'Overseas\' patch of Scouting informally by Scouts and Scouters, because while a few were earned by Scouts and Scouters taking part in events in Canada or Mexico, many more...the majority...were earned by Scouts and Scouters serving as members of the Transatlantic (Europe, Near East, and North Africa), Far East (Far East, Japan, and the Phillipines), Canal Zone (Panama) and Direct Service (all other areas around the world) Councils. Scouts and Scouters in those Councils routinely had interactions with host-nation Scouting groups and many of those Scouts and Scouters developed lifelong associations with individuals and groups over the years, camping and doing social events with them and their members. As those folks came back to the States, proudly displaying their World Crest, they were singled out for many special tasks and events in their Councils because \'they have done something with foriegn Scouts\'.',167,''),(3643,'\0',4,'So why does EVERYONE get to wear it now?\n\nMy best guess is that there were many jealous Scouts and Scouters that could not go overseas, could not atttend a Jamboree or some other event, and could not, therefore, earn the World Crest. The BSA did something about this, in 1990, and changed the rules allowing for Scouts and Scouters in the USA to earn a World Crest by simply \'taking part in an international exhibit or display or an international event.\', whether or not Scouts from another country were present or not. Robert Zadima, the Council Executive of the Transatlantic Council and his Far East counterpart, along with some members of other US local councils, strongly made their objections known to the BSA\'s National Director of Operations and to the International Division, but those appeals fell on deaf ears, and the policy was changed.\n\nIn 1991, the BSA once again changed the policy over the objections of many local councils, whose volunteers and professionals had grown to respect the World Crest and what it stood for. The present policy is that the patch WILL BE WORN BY ALL YOUTH MEMBERS AND BY ALL ADULTS, VOLUNTEER OR PROFESSIONAL, AS A SIGN OF WORLD BROTHERHOOD AND UNITY WITH OTHER MEMBERS OF THE INTERNATIONAL SCOUTING COMMUNITY.\n\nIs there anything that has taken the place of the World Crest?\n\nIn order to earn the World Crest Badge before 1991, you must have participated in an international Scouting event or activity lasting five days or more. Today, each local Council has the authority to determine requirements for the International Activities badge, a 3-inch patch which is worn as a TEMPORARY EMBLEM on the right pocket of the Scout or Scouter. It is NOT worn in the PLACE OF or alongside the World Crest emblem.\n\ninternational activities badge\n\nAdditionally, the BSA has developed the World Conservation Awards for Boy Scouts and Cub Scouts and this emblem is likewise a TEMPORARY EMBLEM to be worn on the right pocket of the Scout. Scouters cannot earn the World Conservation Award. The World Conservation Award is NOT a PERMANENT award, and therefore only the World Crest Badge is worn on the left side of the shirt above the pocket (or above square knot insignia and/or year pins).\n\nHere are one local Councils\' requirements for the International Activities Badge;\n\nand here are my comments and opinions on the current usage of the World Crest Badge.',167,''),(3644,'\0',1,'For a number of years, BSA has offered to Cub Scouts and Boy Scouts the Donor Awareness Patch shown above.

The patch is still being produced, but some Scout Shops may not routinely stock the patch. To avoid disappointing Scouts, CHECK FIRST to see if any are available in your area before promoting this program and patch. Of course, promoting Donor Awareness is still a valid project for Scouts, and can be done, even without the opportunity to get this patch.\n\nThere are NO formal requirements for these patches. Each Unit establishes the procedure for awarding the strip. Usually, a Donor Awareness Patch is awarded to a Cub Scout or Boy Scout the first time he is successful in getting an adult family member, friend, relative, or other acquaintance to agree to become an organ donor, and to fill out and carry an Organ Donor Card.\n\nTypically, a unit will award only ONE patch to a boy while a member of that unit.',168,''),(3645,'\0',1,'This Award is meant for Boy Scouts.\nDecide for yourself if it is appropriate for your younger scouts or not.\nThe Distinguished Service Award was created in 1940 to honor those who rendered service to the Order beyond the lodge level.

Compasses, watches, GPS, LED lights, and other outdoor gear has improved over the years and scouts have taken advantage of those improvements.
