	ScoutTrax User Guide
</h1>

<h2>
	Welcome
</h2>

<p>
	Welcome to <a id="scouttraxlink" href="www.scouttrax.org">ScoutTrax.org</a>, an innovative scout tracking tool with
	features you won't find together in any other scout tracking software.
	ScoutTrax was created by software professionals who do this for free
	because they are passionate about scouting.
</p>

<p>
	<h3>
		ScoutTrax is:
	</h3>
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<h4>
			Simple and free, one-click tracking.
		</h4>
	</li>
	<ul>
		<li>
			View a scout's complete record on a single page.
		</li>
		<li>
			Don't worry about whether the next scout master or sponsoring
			organization will continue to pay for the program. It is free and
			will stay free.
		</li>

		<li>
			Smart software: i.e. if your leader registers in a particular city,
			ScoutTrax assumes everyone else will be in the same city. You don't
			spend time putting in the same city, state and zip code for every
			single user.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<li>
		<h4>
			Accessible to scouts, parents and leaders on the web, all the time.
		</h4>
	</li>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Gives the power to the scout to be more involved with his own progress.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<li>
		<h4>
			Facilitates communication between scouts, parents and leaders.
		</h4>
	</li>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Automatically emails reminders and status updates to all.
		</li>

		<li>
			scouts, leaders, and parents all have access to their records and
			provide a check and balance for entered data.
		</li>
		<li>
			ScoutTrax keeps track of information not kept by the council's
			program. For example, a scout's leadership position history, camping
			history, service hours, and partial merit badges are tracked and
			easily communicated to a succeeding scout master.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<li>
		<h4>
			Safe, Secure and Private
		</h4>
	</li>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Data is kept safe by regular offsite data backups.
		</li>
		<li>
			Privacy is protected by encrypted passwords and other security
			measures.
		</li>

	</ul>
	<h2>
		Getting Started
	</h2>

	<p style="color:red;font-size:1.3em;">
		Watch the "Getting Started" video on the home page. It will step you
		through the following:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>
			Create a ScoutTrax account
		</li>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Download the PDF or ASPX of your scout's advancement records from
				your council website. This link is usually found on your council
				website. Scoutmasters and unit leaders will know the unit ID
				required for this step.
			</li>
			<li>
				Login to your advancement link from your council's website. (Only
				Internet Explorer and Firefox will work. Chrome and Safari will not
				work.)
			</li>
			<li>
				Click on "Unit Advancement Summary" in the upper right corner.
			</li>
			<li>
				Once the file loads, save it. By default it will have the name of
				"UnitAdvancementSummary.aspx" If you will be downlowding more than
				one unit record, you may want to rename it, i.e.
				TroopAdvancementSumary.aspx, or TeamAdvancementSumary.aspx, or
				CrewAdvancementSumary.aspx.
			</li>
			<li>
				Then login to ScoutTrax.org.
			</li>
			<li>
				On the troop management page, next to the "Select Unit Advancement
				PDF file" select the "Browse...".
			</li>
			<li>
				Select the the file you downloaded above.
			</li>
			<li>
				Select import. After a few minutes you should see your scouts' names
				appear on the right side with all the council records now imported.
			</li>
			<li>
				Repeat this process if necessary for other units (i.e. Troop, Team
				or Crew).
			</li>
		</ol>
	</ul>

	<h2>
		Features
	</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<b>Automatic emails</b> are sent to the scout when a leader makes
			changes to his merit badges, campouts, service or other items.
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Scout birthday reminders</b> are automatically e-mailed to the
			scout's leaders. Some items such as the Eagle award are affected by a
			birthday. The leaders are emailed 30 days before the scout's birthday
			and again the day of the scout's birthday. This will help the leader
			remember to review that scout's record to make sure he is ready to
			progress. It also gives the new leader advanced notice so he can
			prepare for the incoming scout.
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Security</b> is ensured with password encrypted and protected
			accounts.
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Reports</b> can be customized by date. This makes it easier to
			report changes since the last Court of Honor or to see how a scout
			has been progressing over a given time period.
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Personalize</b> a scout's account by uploading his photo.
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Provide feedback</b> in the top right corner next to the Logout
			link. Your feedback will be used to address individual concerns and
			to know what features to add next.
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Record Transfer-</b> Scouts can be transferred to another troop.
			If the scout's new troop is not using ScoutTrax, the new troop is
			given the opportunity to create an account in ScoutTrax. They can
			begin to use ScoutTrax or simply retrieve the scout's information.
		</li>
		<li>
			Looks and performs like your scout book, but you will never lose it.
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Easy</b> to learn and to use for one scout or 100.
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Password recovery</b> is available when a scout or leader has
			forgotten it. The password is sent to the e-mail that ScoutTrax has
			on record for that user.
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Backups- </b> All data is backed up regularly off-site to prevent
			data loss, and to allow quick recovery.
		</li>
	</ul>

	<ul>
		<li>
			<b>Merit Badge Tracking-</b> Tracks merit badges earned and which
			requirements of partially completed merit badges have been completed.
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Service Tracking-</b> Tracks service hours for each scout.
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Camp Tracking-</b> Tracks camping history of each scout. This
			feature is very useful for verifying requirements for the camping
			merit badge.
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Leadership</b>
			<b>Tracking-</b> Tracks a scout's leadership history.
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Duty to God tracking-</b> The "DTG" tab is for tracking the scout's
			progress in the requirements of the Church of Jesus Christ of
			Latter-Day Saints. This is not meant to replace the church's own
			website, which is an excellent resource, but allows a leader to see
			where all the scouts are at once. Also, it provides one place and one
			way to keep track of a scout's progress in scouting and/or with Duty To
			God.
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Enter data for several scouts at once.</b> Choose any number of
			scouts when passing off requirements for merit badges or adding data
			such as camping information. This reduces time when recording the
			same data for more than one scout. Leaders can even do this with a
			single click.
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>At-a-glance information for a selected scout.</b> When a scout is
			selected, the images of his earned merit badges display at the top of
			the page. The rank the scout is working on along with any partial
			merit badge are displayed in the right pane.
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Not just a scout master's tool-</b> Each scout or parent can have
			a personalized account. This allows a scout or parent to see and
			update his progress at any time. For privacy reasons, they cannot
			view other scouts' records, like a leader can.
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Like a scout book,</b> each parent or scout can sign off awards
			and requirements. However, only leaders can sign off things like a
			Scout Master Conference or a Board of Review. FYI: When a leader
			views the records, requirements Recorded by a parent or scout will be
			outlined in red. He may choose to focus more heavily on these
			requirements at the Scout Master Conference.
		</li>
		<li>
			If there is a popular new feature people want, we'll add it. Just
			click on the
			<b>feedback</b> link in the upper right hand corner of the software,
			or comment on
			<b>facebook.com/ScoutTrax</b> to report problems, ask questions or
			give suggestions.
		</li>
	</ul>
