<h1>ScoutTrax.org User Guide</h1>
<p class='center subtitle'>for Leaders, Parents and Scouts</p>
<div><ol id="toc"></ol></div>
<h2>Welcome</h2>

<p>Welcome to <a href="http://www.scouttrax.org/">ScoutTrax.org</a>
, an innovative scout tracking tool with features you
won't find together in any other scout tracking software. ScoutTrax.org was created
by software professionals who do this for free because they are passionate
about scouting.</p>

<h4>ScoutTrax.org is: </h4>
<h5>Simple and free, one-click tracking.</h5>

 <ul type=circle>
  <li >View a scout's complete record on a single page. </li>
  <li >Don't worry about whether the next unit or sponsoring
      organization will continue to pay for the program. It is free and will
      stay free. </li>
 </ul>

<h5>Accessible to scouts, parents and leaders on the web,
all the time.</h5>

 <ul type=circle>
  <li>ScoutTrax.org gives the power to the scout and his parents
      to be more involved with his progress. </li>
  <li>Lost handbook?No worries. The online
      record is safe and permanent. <i>Note:</i>ScoutTrax.org is not designed to replace
      all the information in the handbooks.  It is, however, a secure and efficient way to track progress
      and save records.)Like the BSA, we recommend that a physical copy of all scout records be kept. 
      </li>
  <li>ScoutTrax.org keeps track of information not included in
      the handbooks, like requirements for belt loops, pins, and religious emblems.</li>
 </ul>

<h5>Facilitates communication between scouts, parents and
leaders.</h5>

 <ul type=circle>
  <li>Leaders can email any or all members of their
      unit from one simple location to remind them of upcoming events.</li>
  <li>Leaders, parents and scouts all have access to their records and provide checks and balances for entered data. </li>
  <li>When a leader or parent signs off a requirement, the
      record is viewable by both leaders and parents, updated in real time.</li>
  <li>When a record is updated an email automatically
      notifies the parent.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Safe, Secure and Private </h5>


<ul type=circle>
  <li>Data is kept safe by regular offsite data backups. </li>
  <li>Privacy is protected by encrypted passwords and other
      security measures. </li>
</ul>

<p> 
<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<h5>Troops that belong to the same organization as a Pack that is already registered - Start here!</h5>
<ol>
<li> If the same person is maintaining records for both cubs and older scouts, two separate accounts (with separate user names and passwords) are required - one for cubs, and another for Boy, Varsity and Venture Scouts. (The latter three can be tracked together.)  Both accounts, however, can use the same email. </li>
<li> The leader should login as usual. </li>
<li> On your Pack manage screen, near the bottom locate the "Invite Troop" button. Click this button and enter the leader name, pack and email address. Then invite this leader to join ScoutTrax.org.</li>
<li> The user will receive an email inviting her to join. If an email is not found, check the email spam folder.</li>
<li> Now you are ready to start adding boys, and leaders and inviting them to join you in helping these boys achieve!</li>
</ol>
<h5>Troops Independent of a Pack - Start here!</h5>
<ol>
<li> There are videos that will help you get started with ScoutTrax for Cubs. They are geared specifically to the older boys but the basic functionality is the same. Cub specific videos are in production.</li>
<li> After viewing the videos, or if you choose to skip the videos, click on the "Start Now".</li>
<li> This will take you to the page where you can start registration and access the "Troop User Guide" near the bottom of the page. We recommend that you click on the "Cub User Guide click here" now, so you can use this for reference.</li>
<li> When ready select the "Not registered yet? click here".</li>
<li> Follow the instructions on the screens to register.</li>
</ol>

<p> 
<span style='color:red'>Watch the &quot;Getting Started&quot; video on the home page.</span></p>
<p>It will step you through creating your account, importing your boys' records, managing your unit and other helpful hints.</p>

		<img alt="Getting Started" src="images/gettingstarted.png"></a>

<h5>Create a ScoutTrax.org account </h5>

 <ul type=circle>
  <li>Any scout leader may register
from the home page of ScoutTrax.org. Enter information including state, city,
council, charter organization, group, unit type, and unit number. Drop-down
menus will help you along the way. If
you register as a troop, each scout you add to the records will, by
default, be added to the troop. This can
easily be changed if you wish to create records for other unit types. Continue
to the next screen until registration is complete.</li>

<li>To complete account activation,
check your email for a link from ScoutTrax.org. 
By clicking on this link, you will automatically be sent to the "Unit
Management" page. Now you are ready to add
scouts. </li>

<li>Click on "Add Scout" and enter
information for each scout in your unit.</li>

<li>If you have not added all the scouts
in your unit, invite other leaders to add their scouts'
information. You can do this from the same
"Unit Management" page (see below). When
they respond to the invite, ScoutTrax.org will recognize them as being in the same
unit as you. This way all scouts in your unit can be viewed by any leader as
needed. Also, when a scout advances
to another unit, his records are already viewable by his new leaders.</li>
</ul>

			were earned for these boys. If you are not sure, just enter a date over 10 years ago.

<h2>Additional Features </h2>

 <ul type=circle>
  <li><b>Automatic emails</b>
      are sent to a parent when updates are made to his son's records.</li>
  <li><b>Scout birthday reminders</b> are automatically e-mailed to the leaders. In
      some units, the deadline for rank advancement is a birthday. The leaders
      are emailed 30 days before the scout's birthday and again the day of his
      birthday. This will help the leader remember to review that scout's record
      to make sure he is ready to progress. It also gives the new leaders
      advanced notice so they can prepare for the incoming scout. Note:</i> For obvious reasons, this
      feature only works if a birth date has been entered in the scout's
      personal information.</li>
  <li><b>Personalize</b>
      a scout's account by uploading his photo. </li>
 </ul>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<h4>What if ScoutTrax.org does not have a
feature I would like to use?</h4>

<p>If there is a popular new feature
people want, we'll add it! Just click on the <b>Feedback</b> link in the upper
right hand corner of the software, or comment on <b>facebook.com/ScoutTrax</b>
to report problems, ask questions or give suggestions. You will be happy to
know feedback is reviewed frequently, and any problems reported are usually
handled within 48 hours.</p>

<h4>What if a scout moves? </h4>

<p>ScoutTrax.org
makes record transfer easy.  If the scout's new unit is not using ScoutTrax.org, the new unit
is given the opportunity to create an account in ScoutTrax.org. They can begin to
use ScoutTrax.org or simply retrieve the scout's information. </p>

<h4>What if I send an invite to a leader or scout and they don't see it?</h4>
<p>The first email from ScoutTrax.org sometimes get sent to a spam folder. If you send 
an invite and the user does not see it, ask him to check his email spam folder.</p>

<h4>How many scouts can ScoutTrax.org have in one unit? </h4>
<p>Use it for one scout or one hundred. </p>

<h4>What if I forget my password?</h4>

<p>Password recovery is available when a scout or leader
has forgotten it. The password is sent to the e-mail that ScoutTrax.org has on
record for that user. </p>

<h4>What if I cannot find the Religious Emblem of my faith?</h4>

<p>Religious Emblem tracking for any
particular faith will be <b>added upon
request</b> by clicking on the "Feedback" link. Currently the &quot;Faith&quot;
tab includes "Faith in God" progress in the requirements of the Church of Jesus
Christ of Latter-Day Saints. </p>

<h4>How do I pass off a requirement for several scouts at once?</h4>

<p>From the "Book" choose any number of
scouts from the "Roster" at the right. Pass off the same requirement for
all selected scouts by clicking on a requirement's checkbox. This reduces
time when recording the same data for more than one scout. </p>

<h4>How does a parent update a scout's achievements?</h4>

<p>Each parent can have a personalized
account, which allows him/her to see and update his/her child's progress at any time. A
leader must first send an invitation to a parent from the "Unit" page by
clicking on the check box next to the scout's name; then click &quot;Send
Invitation.&quot; Once a parent has accepted the invitation and established a
username and password, he/she can access the record at any time. For privacy reasons, parents cannot view
other scouts' records, like a leader can. </p>

<h4>How is accuracy safeguarded?</h4>

<p>When a scout's record has been updated, an email automatically notifies the parent with a specific list of changes
made. The parent can review this list to ensure accuracy.</p>

<p>When a leader views the records,
requirement dates will be outlined in red if they were recorded by someone other
than the leader. If there is ever a
question, the leader can simply phone or email the parent for verification. </p>
